Migration Tools

## Use Cases

- You're an nvidia user and the traditional rpmfusion consumption model isn't working out for you, but you want to stay on Fedora.
- You've decided to leave Fedora anyway for something else and you have nothing to lose if you try this new fangled Silverblue and/or Universal Blue on your way out. Who knows, you might like it!
- You're helping a friend and don't have time because upgrading in place is faster than restoring their user data after a clean reinstall. 
- No need to make a new USB key or download a new image manually, we'll do it on the spot for you.
